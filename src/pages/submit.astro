        Moon Base Books accepts submissions during the first two weeks of every
        month for our online journal Wavelet and during the month of January for
        chapbook- or book-length works [submissions upcoming in 2025!].
    </p>
    <p>
        To submit send us an email. Put "Wavelet" or "Book" in the title and add
        your work as an attachment. And please feel free to tell us about your
        submission and about who you are. Having more information about the work
        and its context is more important to us than vain attempts at
        objectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coming in 2025 we will also have a discord server where we hope to host
        writing groups, book clubs, and even seminars on technical topics
        specifically geared towards a lay audience.
