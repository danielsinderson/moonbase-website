        Moon Base Books is an independent publisher started by Daniel Sinderson
        in late 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a id="inline-link" href="https://www.danielsinderson.com">Daniel Sinderson</a> is a poet and researcher
        working in Ashland, Oregon. He has degrees in Anthropology, Electronics,
        and Mathematics, and he can stop any time he wants to. He's the man behind
        the curtain at Moon Base Books, so if something here sucks or breaks you know exactly
        who to blame.

    <h1>Submissions</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        [submissions upcoming in 2025!].
    </p>
    <p>
        Moon Base Books will accept submissions twice every year for our 
        digital literary magazine Wavelet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wavelet is planned to be a fully digital and downloadable magazine
        that you can open any time you please on your browser. Being digital
        has three very important advantages over a print magazine. It's cheaper.
        It doesn't take space on your shelf, on your floor, or in your garbage.
        And the set of representable mediums is much richer. We plan to exploit 
        this often.
    </p>
    <p>
        Submission are done by email. Put "Wavelet" in the title then add
        your work as an attachment. And please feel free to tell us about your
        submission and about who you are. Having more information about the work
        and its context is more important to us than vain attempts at
        objectivity.
